# CAPSTONE---Detecting-Breast-Cancer-using-NRL
Devised an approach using protein gene expression profiles and NRL to predict breast cancer by constructing a gene-gene graph network.


(Python, ML, Graph Representation Learning)
▪ Orchestrated an approach that allows us to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not 
by looking at their protein gene expression profiles, incorporating NRL.
▪ Designed a gene-gene graph network being able to encapsulate 100% of the original 
dataset, based on predicting target variables for Graph Pre-processing.
▪ Applied DeepWalk on graph data to attain a reduced dimension dataset for downstream 
analysis. The resulted dataset is around ~ 70% smaller than the original dataset.
▪ Constructed a Logistic Regression and Deep Neural Network Model to compare the 
performance of the proposed methodology. Improved the accuracy score from 0.6 to ~ 0.9 
for both models.
